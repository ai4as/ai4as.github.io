Modern computing systems are large and heterogeneous. Their complexity is hardly manageable by a human being, especially when it comes to take timely decisions in highly dynamic environments or to guarantee strict Quality-of-Service requirements.  Not surprisingly, recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) significantly impacted and fostered the development of autonomous computing systems, providing new or enhanced methodologies to cope with system complexity and uncertainty. AI and ML techniques are increasingly adopted to assist or guide system self-adaptation, as they are used, e.g., to extract relevant information from highly-dimensional and noisy monitoring data, to predict internal or external dynamics, to automatically plan adaptation actions. 

However, there are still several challenges to face for researchers and practitioners aiming to take advantage of these methodologies and incorporate them in their systems. Fundamental issues towards the applicability of AI and ML techniques across diverse domains must be investigated, especially as regards the accuracy, robustness, explainability, safety, security, performance and sustainability of AI-driven autonomous  computing systems. 

In this workshop, we solicit high quality contributions that fit with the overarching theme of AI and ML meeting autonomous computing systems. 

**We invite submissions of original research papers, as well as vision papers.**
