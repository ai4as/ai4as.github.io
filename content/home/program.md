## Keynote

### From Attack Trees to Timed Stochastic Games: a Novel Intrusion Response Approach

Self-Protecting Systems (SPS) are envisioned as the next frontier in the runtime protection of computer systems, and are usually designed following a pipeline that combines at least two stages: Intrusion Detection and Intrusion Response. While the former has been investigated for decades, Intrusion Response is a relatively new field of research, which slowly gained interest in the past few years, in part due to the advances in the field of Artificial Intelligence. Most recent Intrusion Response Systems (IRSs) use models to characterize the attack patterns and the dynamics of the protected system. Such models are typically based on some mathematical framework, and thus require a low-level modeling activity that is often difficult and error prone, even to the experienced end-user. Furthermore, most of the model-based approaches proposed so far do not structurally include the notion of time, which is necessary to model non-instantaneous defense and attack actions. In this talk, we introduce a novel methodology for the automatic generation of IRSs based on Timed Competitive Stochastic Games from augmented Attack-Defense Trees (ADT), a formalism that is commonly used to represent attack patterns. We show that the resulting stochastic game always yields a reward that is at least as good as the reward obtainable with an augmented ADT and discuss the scalability of the proposed approach in terms of planning time and memory usage.

### Speaker
Stefano Iannucci is an Assistant Professor of Computer Engineering at Roma Tre University and an Adjunct Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at Mississippi State University. He received his Ph.D. in 2015 from the University of Rome Tor Vergata. His research is in the broad area of autonomic computing and, more recently, Intrusion Response.

He published over 30 papers in top journals and conferences. Dr. Iannucci has chaired several international workshops and has been the workshops chair for IEEE ICCAC 2017 and ACM/SPEC ICPE 2023. He is Associate Editor of Springer Cluster Computing and part of the Review Board of IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems.
