## Keynote

### A Journey into Integrating Machine Learning and Model-Based Techniques for CPS Autonomy

The realm of cyber-physical systems (CPS) is rapidly evolving, with increasing demands for systems that possess not only automation and intelligence but also the capability to autonomously manage themselves in dynamic environments. This presentation delves into the synergistic integration of machine learning (ML) and model-based techniques as a novel approach to address the complexities of designing self-managing CPS. This presentation explores the fusion of machine learning (ML) and model-based techniques in the design of self-managing cyber-physical systems (CPS). By combining domain knowledge and data-driven insights, this integrated approach enhances CPS autonomy, adaptability, and decision-making. The talk covers real-world applications, benefits, challenges, and strategies for achieving synergy between ML and model-based methods. Attendees will gain insights into the evolving landscape of CPS design, learning how to create more sophisticated and self-managing systems through this collaborative paradigm.

### Speaker
**Sherif Abdelwahed** is a Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU), where he teaches and conducts research in the area of computer engineering, with specific interests in autonomic computing, cyber-physical systems, formal verification and cyber-security. Before joining VCU in August 2017, he served as the associate director of the Distributed Analytics and Security Institute at Mississippi State University (MSU). He was also is also an Associate Professor in the ECE Department at MSU. He received his Ph.D in 2002 from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Toronto. Throughout his academic tenure, Dr. Abdelwahed pioneered work on model-based design of autonomic computing systems and self-managing systems using control-theoretic techniques and model-integrated computing concepts. His research interests also include Cyber security and model-based self-protection, design and analysis of cyber-physical systems, fault diagnosis, modeling and analysis of discrete-event and hybrid systems, and formal verification. Dr. Abdelwahed has chaired several international conferences and conference tracks, and has served as technical committee member at various national and international conferences. He received the StatePride Faculty award for 2010 and 2011, the Bagley College of Engineering Hearin Faculty Excellence award in 2010, and the 2016 Faculty Research Award from the Bagley College of Engineering at MSU. He has more than 180 publications and is a senior member of the IEEE.
