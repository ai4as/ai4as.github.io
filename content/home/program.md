## Keynote


**Towards an Autonomous Patient Recommendation System**

**Speaker**: [Shahram Rahimi](https://sites.google.com/view/shahramrahimi), University of Alabama

*Abstract.* This work advances the development of an autonomous patient recommendation system by leveraging knowledge graphs (KGs) to map and analyze patient journeys. We introduce the Patient Journey Ontology (PJO) to systematically represent diagnoses, treatments, and outcomes, enabling the construction of interoperable Patient Journey Knowledge Graphs (PJKGs). Using large language models, clinical dialogues are automatically transformed into structured PJKGs that capture the complete trajectory of patient care. To power recommendations, we propose the Dynamic Feature and Temporal Similarity (DFTS) framework, which integrates feature based and temporal similarity with dynamic weighting, designed to work effectively even with limited healthcare data. A case study in chronic disease management demonstrates the system’s ability to identify comparable patient journeys and generate personalized recommendations. This work establishes a foundation for autonomous, data-driven decision support that enhances patient-centered healthcare delivery.

**About the speaker:**

Dr. Shahram Rahimi is the Department Head of Computer Science at The University of Alabama and serves as Chief Advisor to the Alabama Cyber Institute. He previously held the position of Gloria & Douglas Marchant Endowed Chair Professor and Head of the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Mississippi State University, and prior to that was Professor and Chair of the Department of Computer Science at Southern Illinois University. Dr. Rahimi has a distinguished background spanning both academia and industry, including roles with NASA and IBM. A recognized expert in artificial intelligence, he has published more than 350 peer-reviewed articles and holds multiple patents and pending patents. He has served as Editor-in-Chief for major AI journals and sits on the editorial boards of several others. Dr. Rahimi has contributed to numerous federal task forces, advising on predictive analytics for policy and defense. His hybrid game-theory system, *Foresight*, is widely used as a decision-support tool in foreign policy. He also led the development of *EmTime/Symphony*, an intelligent algorithm for ER staffing now deployed in more than 1,000 emergency departments nationwide, and recognized by *HealthTech* magazine in 2018 as one of the top 10 AI healthcare technologies. Over the past two decades, Dr. Rahimi has organized 15 international conferences on computational intelligence and multi-agent systems and has served as principal investigator on more than $25 million in federally and industry-funded research projects.
